title: "HPC architecture"
# Objective: Provide a general mind map of how HPC resources are connected together (head node, compute node, NAS)
questions:
- "What is a high-performance computer?!"
- "How are high-performance computers different from personal computers?"
- "How do these differences influence how I use HPC systems most effectively?"
keypoints: 
- "A high-performance computer system provides a larger compute capability than is possible to package in a personal computer."
- "HPC systems are typically an aggregation of a bunch computers, each one of which can look pretty similar to your personal computer."
- "HPC systems are usually accessed remotely, over the network."
- "HPC systems are usually shared among many users.  Each user typically gets a dedicated portion of the computer's resources for a period of time."
- "Special measures have to be taken to provide a file system that can keep up with an HPC system."
- "HPC systems often provide a lot of different software packages, and provide ways of selecting and configuring them to get the environment you need."
